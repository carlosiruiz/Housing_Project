## Introduction
This is a project where I am looking to predict housing prices in Seatle, Washington. With this goal in mind i have proceeded in generating features that might assist in providing my predictive models a better understanding of the data. Using this data I set up to answer the following questions:

```
1. How Good can our model predict our data?
2. Did the grade provided affected the sale of the house?
3. Is there a popular month where sales took place?

```

## Investigation
